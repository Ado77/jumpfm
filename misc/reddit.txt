tl;dr
I made JumpFm (http://bit.ly/2uBFWIC), need your feedback

Hi,

I decided to format my machine last weekend. 
Then, after reinstalling almost everything, I was about to reinstall double commander.
Basically, I like double commander but it takes me a lot of configuration to bring it to a state that I can work with it.
I also came across fman (http://bit.ly/2uBwIw6) couple of weeks ago, and it seems really great but it is not an open source and requires a subscription fee.
Also, I haven't done any programming for quite a while and wanted to refresh my memory a bit.
For all the above reasons I decided to start a new side project and create my own file manager - JumpFm (http://bit.ly/2uBFWIC).
It is currently in a very early stage but there is already a working version. It was only tested on my machine but it seems to do what is suppose to do.
I'm planning to keep working on this project and would really appreciate your feedback:
- Which FM are you using ?
- What features do you like/need/must ?
- Feedback about the site/help/etc...
- Bugs

Thank you very much,
Gilad
