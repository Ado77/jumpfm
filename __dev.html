    <p>Currently, there is no mechanism to distribute third party plugins. If you want
        to write your own plugin for personal usage you can start with the following
        code snippet:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code class='language-js'>
    import 'plugin.js'
</code>
</pre>
    <p>* Also, don't forget to register your plugin in the <code>plugins.json</code>        file</p>
